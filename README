Triangulating Context Lemmas
=============================

Agda formalisation to accompanying paper ``Triangulating Context Lemmas" by
Craig McLaughlin, James McKinna and Ian Stark.

Dependencies:
  * Agda version 2.5.1
  * Agda standard library v0.12

NB: There is no correspondence between the lemma numbering in the paper and
that in the formalisation, having been based on a previous write-up of the
results. However, the main results (triangulation for big-step/frame stack)
are at the bottom of the respective files (tri-big-step.agda/tri-frm-stk.agda)
under the "Summary" heading.
